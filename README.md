This Airbnb dataset contains 48895 data points and 16 features. 
I choose the "calculated_host_listings_count" as my target variable, whose type is Int64, and plan to do a regression.
The significance of predicting target variables in actual business is to predict the number of times a certain room receives tenants. 
Extending from this business idea, we can make a recommendation system for tenants and a ranking and scoring system for rooms.
